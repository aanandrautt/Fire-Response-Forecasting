# ML–Based Structural Response Forecasting and Early Warning System for RC Frame Structures under Fire

## Files of Interest

1. LSTM-working_3.0_OptunaALL.ipynb
- Main notebook containing:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Model training and validation
  - Hyperparameter optimization (Optuna)
  - Forecasting and evaluation routines

2. Input_variables
  - Input parameter descriptions used to generate FE simulations.

## NOTE:
- FE simulations are performed externally using GiD–OpenSees and are not included due to size.
- The notebook operates on pre-generated datasets consistent with those described in the manuscript.
